Q1. A .gitignore file contain all files and folders that need not to be tracked by the git. Files are ignored becuase they serve no purpose in main peoject, they might be intermediaries generated that are unnecessary to  be included in the source thereby increasing repository size. Class(.class), Log(.log), BlueJ(.ctxt), Packages(.rar, .zip, .jar, .war, .nar, .ear, .tar.gz) and crash logs are ignored in java.
Q2. A fast-forward is moving of main branch tip to current branch tip when there is a linear path between them. This is possible when no changes are made to main since the branch is created allowing directly to combine the history of branch to main.
Q3. Branches create a separate development line and help to keep the changes off of the main branch until the development of new features is completed. Branches facilitate multiple new changes allowed at a single time that later can be merged with main if working properly.
Q4. A project can contain multiple repositories. Having multiple repositories will break huge projects and increases manageability but might induce dependency issues which need to be handled. A single repository is named origin and multiple repositories must be uniquely named.
